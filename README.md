Our website
https://quizhub.live/
You have to register and log in to be able to post questions

The feature that we have implemented is that the users can see the results of the how other people did on the question. 

To test this feature:
  1. Start your server using docker compose up
  2. Open two browsers and navigate to http://localhost:8080
  3. Open 2 browsers and register and login on both
  4. On one of the browsers post a question and go to the answers page
  5. On second browser answer that question
  6. After the time is up, the result button should appear
  7. Clicking it will show a graph of all submissions and what answers were picked
